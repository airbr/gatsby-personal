### Gatsby sure looks great

#### I blocked off just 30 mins to working on starting a personal page and I made progress. I felt encouraged. Hot Reloading is good.



##### I have encountered issues in the past with personal side projects whenever I have run into configuring Webpack. I know the community and tools have come a long way but it always felt like a huge mental investment before you even really got to making content!

* Really glad to not have to configure a few more things before getting started

# React?

> one person at my local coding meetup said, "I wrote a lot of jQuery years ago, when you go from jQuery to React, you don't really go back".

> ## Maybe I will get there



#### Tried to do a quick remix of personal single page websites and it is apparent that they cant really be quickly just copied and pasted into JSX.
